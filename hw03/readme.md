### Review

Overall, I ran into a lot of errors with this project. I struggled a lot with the whole process, and had to frequently return to the Kaltura to get anything done. 

I couldn't get the build running online because I had my GitHub structured differently, so I couldn't host it the same way. After attempting to solve the problem on my own for around half an hour, I gave up.

This was the most challenging assignment yet, but I see the potential and why this would be useful. I hope I can learn more about it, and get a better understanding for next time.
