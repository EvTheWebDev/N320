# HW02: Custom CLI Tool

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to create and publish a CLI tool to NPM.

Utalizing NPM's Built-In Scripts, this program prompts users to enter a project name, before asking if they want to be a cool guy or a lame Larry.

ReadLine allows me to prompt the user, and fs allows for files to be created and written.
