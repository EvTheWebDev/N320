# HW02: Custom CLI Tool

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to create and publish a CLI tool to NPM.

Utalizing NPM's Built-In Scripts, this program prompts users to enter a project name, before asking if they want to be a cool guy or a lame Larry.

ReadLine allows me to prompt the user, and fs allows for files to be created and written.

### NPM Link [Here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n320-hw02)

## Instructions

To run this project, first install it with `npm i n320-hw02`

Then, use the command `cool-guy` to start the project!
