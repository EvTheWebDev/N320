### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

**Version Control** is the process of managing a project across multiple devices and (usually) multiple developers. Using a tool like GitHub, multiple developers can get a repository installed onto their computer. This repository is where the project will be held. Those various developers can then independantly work on different parts of the project, and "push" them up to the main branch of the project. Other developers can then "pull" this data onto their local copy of the project, and work with the most up-to-date version.
